### Quick Demo

If possible, have a "Deploy to Heroku", "Edit with Glitch" button.


### Prerequisites

1. Have [Python3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Have [Pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
3. Have a [Glitch account](https://www.glitch.com)

\`\`\`shell

git clone https://github.com/eceusc/project-example.git
cd project-example
# set up commands, install dependencies, etc
python3 main.py
\`\`\`

Then, 1 sentence to show what they should see after running the above:

\`\`\`shell
$ python3 main.py
Example server running on port 3000!
