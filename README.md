# Project Template

A template for all ECE USC Open Source project repos!


## What is this?

In our GitHub organization, [@eceusc](https://github.com/eceusc), we have a lot of repositories. Only a few of these repos are "project" repositories, meant specifically for an ECE USC Open Source Project (which are prefixed with `project-`). We want to standardize a few things about these project repositories (e.g., `README` structure, `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, etc. So, this repo has a tool to do just that!


## Usage

Everything you need is inside the `/template` directory - this includes:

### `README.md`

This is a simple skeleton of suggestions of what to put in your repository. Most of the sections are straightforward - `About`, `Getting Started`, `Quick Demo`, `Prerequisites`, etc.

### `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

This Code of Conduct is an adaptations of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), with the [UC San Diego Principles of Community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html) included as well.

### `LICENSE.md`

As of now, just a simple MIT license.


To add these templates to your repo, simple run:

``` bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eceusc/project-template/master/README.md
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eceusc/project-template/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eceusc/project-template/master/LICENSE.md
```
