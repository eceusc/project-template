# Project Template

A template for all ECE USC Open Source project repos! 


## What is this?

In our GitHub organization, [@eceusc](https://github.com/eceusc), we have a lot of repositories. Only a few of these repos are "project" repositories, meant specifically for an ECE USC Open Source Project (which are prefixed with `project-`). We want to standardize a few things about these project repositories (e.g., `README` structure, `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, etc. So, this repo has a tool to do just that!


## Usage

### Templatize a new project repo


### Templatize an existing repo
